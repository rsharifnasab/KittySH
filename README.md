# Kitty Shell

Most minimal shell possible with only basic features (run command/exit) plus anything libraries can provide without hassle (history, auto-complete, ...)

# Motivation

Why not develop a shell named Kitty to create a name clash with Kitty terminal

# How to

build with:

```
go build -o kitty
```

Make sure you have a proper internet connection because there are a few libraries that should be downloaded.

And run with:

```
./kitty
```
